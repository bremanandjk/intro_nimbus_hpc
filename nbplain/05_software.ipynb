    "On Nimbus `module` is used to manage different libraries and pieces of software.  Unlike you own machine where you likely have one set of up packages each running with the latest versions, on Nimbus there are many different applications each with different versions and libraries that they rely on.  Tools like module ensure researchers can access the versions of applications and libraries they want and allow the service to be managed more easily.  It also means that the correct dependencies, typically libraries that are used to compile applications, can be loaded automatically making life easier for users.\n",
